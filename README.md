## Moon scripting language compiler and VM

`Moon` is a custom scripting language that borrows some of its syntax from
[Lua](http://www.lua.org/) and [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

This is mainly a toy/hobby project to learn more about compiler design, Virtual Machines and interpreters.

The name is just a play on the meaning of Lua (Moon in Portuguese). I chose the name on purpose
to leave it clear this is a lame rip-off on the syntax of the popular scripting language.
This project is also in no way affiliated to [MoonScript](https://github.com/leafo/moonscript).
